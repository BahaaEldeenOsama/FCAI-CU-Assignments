Problem (3)

Given two arrays A1[] and A2[], sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the
elements will be the same as those in A2. For the elements not present in A2, append
them at last in sorted order.
Example:
Input: A1[] = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8}
A2[] = {2, 1, 8, 3}

Output: A1[] = {2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
