Given two sorted arrays X[] and Y[] of size m and n each, merge elements of X[] with elements of array Y[] by maintaining the sorted order. i.e. fill X[] with first m smallest elements and fill Y[] with remaining elements.
The conversion should be done in-place and without using any other data structure.
For example,
Input:
X[] = { 1, 4, 7, 8, 10 }
Y[] = { 2, 3, 9 }
Output:
X[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 }
Y[] = { 8, 9, 10}.
