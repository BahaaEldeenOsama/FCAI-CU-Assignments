Find the largest value in each row of this tree.
The output should be: [1, 3, 5]
In the first row, there is only one vertex, the root with value 1;
In the second row, there are two vertices with values 2 and 3, so the largest value is 3;
In the third row, there are two vertices with values 4 and 5, so the largest value is 5.
