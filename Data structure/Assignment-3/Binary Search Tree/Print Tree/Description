Write a print method that takes the node which the mirror image of the tree will start from if no parameter is sent to the function the default value will be the root node.
You must solve this problem by three different algorithms.
(Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)
(a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
(b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
(c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1
