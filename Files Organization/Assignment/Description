We want to store data about Employees and Department. (for simplicity consider any employee belongs to only one department, but any department may have more than one employee)
Employee attributes


Char [13]: Employee_ID //primary
key Char [30]: Dept_ID //sec. key
Char[50]: Employee _Name
Char[50]: Employee _Position


Department attributes
Char [30]: Dept_ID //primary key
Char[50]: Dept_Name //sec. key
Char[50]: Dept_Manger


Consider we want to save 10 Employees and 5 Department.
* Save the data for employees and department in the following format: delimited fields, length indicator records.
* You should develop the following indexes
1. Primary index using the Employee_ID (for Employees datafile)
2. Primary index using the Dept_ID (for Department datafile)
3. Secondary index using Dept_ID (for Employee datafile) //Dept _ID is sec. key in Employees datafile
4. Secondary index using Dept_Name (for Department datafile)
