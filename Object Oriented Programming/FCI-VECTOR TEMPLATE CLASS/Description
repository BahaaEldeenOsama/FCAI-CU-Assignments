Declaring and Defining an FciVector Template class which have all functions like standard vector, declare all FciVector functions and their implementations in FciVector.h using it in main function as a separate file by including FciVector.h to add list of integer, list of character, list of string, list of float, and list of students.
By declaring and defining a class of students with member variables sname (string), sid(integer), sdepartment(string) and a fcivector of (courses class) which contains courseName(string), courseCode(string) , courseGrade(character) , coursePoint(float) , courseYear(integer) and courseSemester(integer). (Please stick to the class diagram in the last page) Sample input/output:
Insert type of vector you would like to create:
1. list of integer
2. list of character
3. list of string
4. list of float
5. list of students
6. Exit
5
A vector of students was created successfully.
What kind of operation would you like to perform?
1. Add element.
2. Remove last element.
3. Insert element at certain position.
4. Erase element from a certain position.
5. Clear.
6. Display first element.
7. Display last element.
8. Display element at certain position.
9. Display vector size.
10. Display vector capacity.
11. Is empty?
